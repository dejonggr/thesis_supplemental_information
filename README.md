**Table S1**: Enriched GO terms among up-regulated and down-regulated differentially expressed gene across all hosts.

**Table S2**: GO enrichment results for DAS genes across all hosts.

**Table S3**: Genes previously found to be associated with a biotic stress response (referenced in figure 4). Based on genes previously analyzed due to their association with *Brassica napus* response to environmental stressors and *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* infection \[1]\[2].

**Figure S1**: Relationship between constitutively mapped reads and alternatively mapped reads demonstrates that AS event expression scales with gene expression.
